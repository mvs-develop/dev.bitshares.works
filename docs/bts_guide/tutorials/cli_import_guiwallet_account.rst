--------------------

CLI and GUI wallet are two separated applications. They use separated ways to represent backups. You can manually import keys from the GUI into the CLI to have a CLI-wallet.

Your wallet private keys have extremely important roles. By importing your private keys to a new CLI-wallet, you can control your account funds from the CLI-wallet.

1. Find your private keys in your GUI-wallet
-------------------------------------------------

  1. Login to your GUI-wallet
  2. Go to [Settings] – [Permissions]. There are Active, Owner, and Memo tabs.
  3. In the each tab, click your public key (or the key image). It will open a private key viewer.
  4. On the form, click [Show], (it might ask you to login) save your each private key and public key information to use later.



.. Important::  Keep the private keys information to a safe place.

2. Connect to a CLI-wallet pointing it to a live node
-----------------------------------------------------------

**Example:**::

    ./programs/cli_wallet/cli_wallet --server-rpc-endpoint ws://localhost:8090
    Or
    ./programs/cli_wallet//cli-wallet -s wss://bitshares.openledger.info/ws

You should get a prompt::

    new>>>

|

3. Set a password and unlock
--------------------------------------

Set a password for your CLI-wallet and unlock.

.. Note::
  - **New Feature:** Keep your password safe. New features will not show your password while you are typing in. :ref:`Click here to check it out. <3-unlock-cli-wallet>`

  - This password does not need to be the same with your GUI-wallet password. You will create a *new wallet* and it will be secured by the new password.

::

    new >>> set_password mypass123
    set_password mypass123
    null

    locked >>> unlock mypass123
    unlock mypass123
    null
    unlocked >>>

|

4. import key(s)
-----------------------------

Import your each private key you saved from your GUI-wallet into your new CLI-wallet.::

    import_key your-account-name ThisIsThePrivateKeyYouSaved

And you are done. No need to claim balance. Your account balances are in there.

.. Note:: If you use the wallet to transfer funds, you just need to import the active private key. However, if you have different Active and Memo keys and use a Memo when you transfer, import the memo private key also.

|

5. Check your account
-------------------------------

Use ``list_my_accounts`` to see your imported account.

And to check balance::

    unlocked >>> list_account_balances your-account-name
    list_account_balances your-account-name
    31016.69330 BTS
    0 CNY
    0 USD

    unlocked >>>
