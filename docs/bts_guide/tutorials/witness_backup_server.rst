Witness - Backup Server
====================================

Backup Server
---------------

To stay a reliable block producer it is recommend you have a **hot swappable** backup server with same specs as the live server running an instance of ``witness_node``.

.. Attention:: IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THIS BACKUP SHOULD **NOT** HAVE THE SAME SIGNING KEY PAIR in the ``config.ini`` as your main node!



**How it works:**

1. Your **live** witness node is signing blocks with the private key which is stated in the ``config.ini``.
2. Your **backup** witness node is running a copy of the software with **another private key** in the ``config.ini``.

.. note:: - generate a new public/private keypair with cli_wallet command: `suggest_brain_key`


3. On a third server you monitor your **live** node on regular intervals with an automated script (e.g.: https://github.com/roelandp/Bitshares-Witness-Monitor).
4. As soon as your **live** node is starting to fail producing blocks the **missing blocks** parameter increases and you can issue a command to **update_witness** to your backupâ€™s **Public Key**.
5. Investigate the issue with your **live** node and stay happy.
