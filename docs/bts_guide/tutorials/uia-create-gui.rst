To allow transaction fees to be paid in the native asset, a core exchange rate is required at which a customer can implicitly trade the UIA into BTS from the assetâ€™s *fee pool*.

This also requires that the fee pool is funded (e.g. by the issuer). Since all prices in DNA are internally represented as *fractions* (i.e. a/b), we need to define a ratio between quote (the UIA) and base (BTS), i.e. the numerator and denominator for price = a/b

:Symbol:   The Symbol defined here will be reserved in the system for your assets. One the asset is created, the symbol cannot be changed again.
:Maximum Supply:  This is also a permanent setting and denotes the maximum amount of shares that can ever exist at the same time.  	Please consult the Networks fees in the explorer!
:Number of Decimal Points:  This is used to denoted the number of decimal places. A 0 will result in an asset that cannot be separated below integer amounts (e.g. 1, 2, ..)
:SmartCoin:   --
:Quote Asset Amount:   Core exchange rate
:Base Asset Amount:   Core exchange rate

.. note:: Symbols with less than 5 characters are very expense. Please consult the Networks fees in the explorer!

Even though the default settings should be fine for most UIAs, we have the option to opt-out of some available features. (By default, or permissions are enabled).

.. Note:: Once a permission has been set to false, the permission cannot be reactivated!

We have the options to opt-out of:

- Enabling Market Fees
- Requiring holders to be white-listed
- Issuer may transfer asset back to himself
- Issuer must approve all transactions
- Disable confidential transactions

.. Note:: that setting these permissions does not imply that the features is enabled. To do so, we would also require to enable the corresponding flag(s). (See below)


Flags (Optional)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The flags are used to actually enable a particular features, such as market fees or confidential transfers.

If we have set the permission to have a market fee, we can enable the market fees here and set a percentage and max. fee.

We here also can enable the requirements for users to be white-listed, enable confidential transfers and give the issuer the power to withdraw its asset from customer accounts.

The asset creation fee
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


The asset creation fee depends on the length of your symbol. 3 Character Symbols are the shortest and are rather expensive while symbols with 5 or more characters are significantly cheaper.

50% of the asset creation fee are used to pre-fill the assets fee pool. From the other 50%, 20% go to the network and 80% go to the referral program. This means, that if you are a life-time member, you get back 40% of the asset creation fee after the vesting period (currently 90 days).
