Witness - Price Feeds
=========================

Price Feeds
-----------------

Besides producing new blocks another very important task of the witness is to feed **ACCURATE** prices into the blockchain. Educational material on how this can be implemented is available in `scripts/pricefeed` at `github <https://github.com/xeroc/python-graphenelib/>`_ together with the corresponding documentation.

Only Block Producing Nodes (active witnesses) are allowed to publish pricefeeds for the **official** currency / smartcoin markets. For any other asset you need to be whitelisted by the creator of the market to be able to publish pricefeeds.

A couple of price feed scripts in various stages of development and for you to code-inspect and try. (You can always setup a testnet node and test the publishing of pricefeeds).
