::

	Please use the set_password method to initialize a new wallet before continuing
	new >>>

Type ``set_password`` and followed by a password and hit [enter]

::

    new >>> set_password supersecretpassphrase


If the password  was saved successfully, it will show ``locked``. The Cli Wallet has been locked, no one can access to the cli wallet without the password.

::

    null
    locked >>>
