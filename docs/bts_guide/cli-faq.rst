CLI Wallet - FAQ
---------------------


.. _cli-faq1:

How can I close the CLI client in a clean way?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Windows closing the whole window produces a nasty exception. In
Windows you can try `ctrl-d` which stops the process but stil produces a
nasty exception.


.. _cli-faq5:

Why does the CLI client crash immediately when I try to run it for the first time?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The CLI client is unable to run on its own, i.e. without being connected
to the witness node (via a web socket connection). So to successfully
run the CLI client you need to do this:

* make sure you have this entry uncommented in the
  `witness_node_data_dir/config.ini` file
  `rpc-endpoint = 127.0.0.1:8090`
* before you start the CLI client, you need to start the witness node
  (and wait a while till it's up and running)

.. Note:: Find more "How to" guide in a Tutorials section.
