What has Changed since DNA 0.9?
*************************************


* **BitAssets are Collateralized Loans from a Counterpartyrisk-Free Smart Contract**:
  Our research has identified an improved mechanism to achieve a solid *peg* of
  bitAssets to its underlay. BitAssets like the bitUSD in DNA 2.0 will
  always trade for *at least* the value of its underlying asset, i.e. $1.
  We have summarized the economical analysis and incentives for market
  participants here: `bitAssets 2.0`_

* **Faster Blocks**:
  Initially, the DNA 2.0 blockchain will come with 3 seconds block
  interval with the option to reduce down to 1 second if shareholders agree.

* **Industrial Performance**:
  DNA 2.0 can support massive load and works well beyond 100k transactions
  per second. Find out how we achieve `industrial performance and scalability`_.

* **New Reactive UI**:
  The DNA 1.0 user interface was powerful but lacking in responsiveness and perfomance. For Bitshares 2.0 we've reimplemented the whole wallet using the React.js framework developed by Facebook, which is well-known for having excellent performance. The new DNA UI is an entirely browser-based wallet, with private keys maintained in the browser.
  We expect a flourishing ecosystem of forked and tweaked wallets based off of
  our UI.

* **Accounts must be registered**:
  In DNA 2.0 we have separated *authorities* from transaction partners.
  Hence, if Alice wants to send funds to Bob, it may be required that only
  Celine signs for that transaction. Also, DNA 2.0 has `a referral program`_.
  Both features combined make it necessary that participants *register* an
  account on the blockchain.

* **No more Hierarchies in Account Names**:
  In DNA 1, there have been hierarchies in account names. Namely, you
  could only create a sub-account ``home.wallet`` if you also owned ``wallet``.
  In DNA 2.0, these hierarchies no longer exist and to register
  ``home.wallet`` you don't need to own ``wallet``.

* **Explicit Privacy**:
  The *TITAN* technology in DNA 2.0 slowed down blockchain processing
  significantly. Because of this and because TITAN did not really offer good
  privacy, we eliminated TITAN as a default transaction feature. 
  Hence: **Account transactions are public now as well.**
  However, since we recognize the value of financial privacy, we offer
  *blinded* transactions that hide the transferred *amount*, and *stealth*
  transactions that hide the sender and receiver. A combination of both is also
  possible.
 
* **Prices are Fractions**:
  To circumvent rounding errors, all prices in DNA 2.0 are represented as
  fractions.

* **Delegates are now Witnesses and Payed Positions are now Budget Items**:
  Since we have separated the business part from the block producing part, we
  now call block producers (formerly known as *delegates*) witnesses, while the
  additional payed position for workers are called budget items.
