cli_wallet folder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* When you start a cli_wallet, you define a cli_wallet program file with other parameters.
* A wallet.json files does not exist as a default. 
* When you import or register an account, and if you so not have a wallet.json file yet, the wallet.json file is created and saved with new chain_id and other values. (*See an example output :ref:`wallet.json <cli-wallet-json-eg>` )

::

    + [programs]
       + [cli_wallet]
           + [CMakeFiles]
           + cli_wallet  (*Program file*)
           + main.cpp
           + wallet.json  (*Not exists after the initial installation*)
           + ...

|

witness_node folder 	
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* When you start a witness_node, you define the witness_node program file with other parameters.
* As a default, a witness_node_data_dir does not exist. When you start the witness_node program and if the witness_node_date_dir does not exist, the folder and inside files will be created.
* The witness_node_date_dir (i.e., database folder) includes a :ref:`config.ini <bts-config-ini-eg>` file. There are parameters you can set values to run the witness_node. We recommend you to examine the configuration items.
