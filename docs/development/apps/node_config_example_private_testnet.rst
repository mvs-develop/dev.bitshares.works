Configuration for Private Testnets
===================================

.. contents:: Table of Contents
   :local:

-------

This section shows the BitShres Blockchain configuration file ``config.ini`` parameter items. The configuration file locates in your data directory and the most parameter items are commented and contain the essential settings to adjust.


.. WARNING:: For a Private testnet, you must add a seed node of your own, you should not connect to the mainnet nor the public testnet.


Example - config.ini (private testnet)
------------------------------------


As a default, most parameters have been commented. You have to uncomment to set the values.

::

	# Endpoint for P2P node to listen on
	p2p-endpoint = 127.0.0.1:11010

	# Endpoint for websocket RPC to listen on

	# Logging configuration is loaded from logging.ini by default.
	# If logging.ini exists, logging configuration added in this file will be ignored.


.. WARNING:: Adjust the value of ``required-participation`` accordingly. If you start a private testnet with the default number 33, the node won't produce blocks.




Example - logging.ini
---------------------

::

	# declare an appender named "stderr" that writes messages to the console
	[log.console_appender.stderr]
	stream=std_error

	# declare an appender named "default" that writes messages to default.log
	[log.file_appender.default]
	# filename can be absolute or relative to this config file
	filename=logs/default/default.log
	# Rotate log every ? minutes, if leave out default to 60
	rotation_interval=60
	# how long will logs be kept (in days), if leave out default to 1
	rotation_limit=7

	# declare an appender named "p2p" that writes messages to p2p.log
	[log.file_appender.p2p]
	# filename can be absolute or relative to this config file
	filename=logs/p2p/p2p.log
	# Rotate log every ? minutes, if leave out default to 60

	# route any messages logged to the default logger to the "stderr" appender and
	# "default" appender we declared above, if they are info level or higher
	[logger.default]

	# route messages sent to the "p2p" logger to the "p2p" appender declared above
	[logger.p2p]

	# route messages sent to the "rpc" logger to the "rpc" appender declared above
	[logger.rpc]

Example - Set up the Second Node
--------------------------------

If you want to set up a second node (with the same genesis file) and connect it to the first node by using the ``p2p-endpoint`` of the first node as the ``seed-node`` for the second. The below are example settings.


**Node-001: config.ini**

::

	p2p-endpoint = 127.0.0.1:11010
	# seed-node =                // add a seed node of your own

	rpc-endpoint = 127.0.0.1:11011


**Node-002: config.ini**

  - Set the Node-001's ``p2p-endpoint`` as the Node-002's ``seed-node``.

::

	p2p-endpoint = 127.0.0.1:11015
	seed-node = 127.0.0.1:11010

	rpc-endpoint = 127.0.0.1:11020
