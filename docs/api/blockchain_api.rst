***********************
Blockchain API(s)
***********************

The blockchain API can be used to obtain any kind of data stored in the blockchain. Besides data stores in the blockchain itself (blocks, transactions, etc. ..), higher level objects (such as accounts, balances, etc. ...) can be retrieved through the full nodeâ€™s database.

It is not required to run a local full node if you want to query a particular blockchain or database, but you can also query any existing public node for information.

---------


The Graphene full node distinguishes several different APIs that can be
accessed as described :ref:`the Websockets documentation <websocket-calls>`.

Access to some APIs may be **restricted** and requires login with username and
passphrase. More detailed description about this can be found on the
:ref:`api-access-and-restrictions` page.
