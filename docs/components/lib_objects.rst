Account 
================



`account_balance_object <https://bitshares.org/doxygen/classgraphene_1_1chain_1_1account__balance__object.html>`_
-----------------------------
- Tracks the balance of a single account/asset pair
- This object is indexed on owner and asset_type so that black swan events in asset_type can be processed quickly

`account_object <https://bitshares.org/doxygen/classgraphene_1_1chain_1_1account__object.html>`_

- Accounts are the primary unit of authority on the graphene system. Users must have an account in order to use assets, trade in the markets, vote for committee_members, etc

Only ``authorized_account`` may do this. Any number of withdrawals may be made so long as the total amount withdrawn per period does not exceed the limit for any given period.

Authority 
================================

`special_authority_object <https://bitshares.org/doxygen/classgraphene_1_1chain_1_1special__authority__object.html>`_ 
-----------------------------------------------------
- ``special_authority_object`` only exists to help with a specific indexing problem. We want to be able to iterate over all accounts that contain a special authority. However, accounts which have a special_authority are very rare. So rather than indexing ``ccount_object`` by the special_authority fields (requiring additional bookkeeping for every account), we instead maintain a ``special_authority_object`` pointing to each account which has ``special_authority`` (requiring additional bookkeeping only for every account which has special_authority).
- This class is an implementation detail.

	class special_authority_object : public graphene::db::abstract_object<special_authority_object>

- ``buyback_authority_object`` only exists to help with a specific indexing problem. We want to be able to iterate over all assets that have a buyback program. However, assets which have a buyback program are very rare. So rather than indexing ``asset_object`` by the buyback field (requiring additional bookkeeping for every asset), we instead maintain a ``buyback_object`` pointing to each asset which has buyback (requiring additional bookkeeping only for every asset which has buyback).
- This class is an implementation detail.

History 
=======================

`operation_history_object <https://bitshares.org/doxygen/classgraphene_1_1chain_1_1operation__history__object.html>`_ 
-----------------------------------------------------
- tracks the history of all logical operations on blockchain state
- All operations and virtual operations result in the creation of an operation_history_object that is maintained on disk as a stack. Each real or virtual operation is assigned a unique ID / sequence number that it can be referenced by.

.. Note:: by default these objects are not tracked, the account_history_plugin must be loaded fore these objects to be maintained.
    this object is READ ONLY it can never be modified 

.. code-block:: cpp 

   class operation_history_object : public abstract_object<operation_history_object>
   {
      public:
         static const uint8_t space_id = protocol_ids;
         static const uint8_t type_id  = operation_history_object_type;

         operation_history_object( const operation& o ):op(o){}
         operation_history_object(){}

         operation         op;
         operation_result  result;
         /** the block that caused this operation */
         uint32_t          block_num = 0;

   };
   
   
`account_transaction_history_object <https://bitshares.org/doxygen/classgraphene_1_1chain_1_1account__transaction__history__object.html>`_ 
-----------------------------------------------------
- a node in a linked list of operation_history_objects
- Account history is important for users and wallets even though it is not part of "core validation". Account history is maintained as a linked list stored on disk in a stack. Each account will point to the most recent account history object by ID. When a new operation relativent to that account is processed a new account history object is allocated at the end of the stack and initialized to point to the prior object.
- This data is never accessed as part of chain validation and therefore can be kept on disk as a memory mapped file. Using a memory mapped file will help the operating system better manage / cache / page files and also accelerates load time.
- When the transaction history for a particular account is requested the linked list can be traversed with relatively efficient disk access because of the use of a memory mapped stack.
