Clients and DNA blockchain network
========================================

In this section, we look into DNA Blockchain transaction and the flow. The below image is simplified clients and nodes relations. And it shows two transactions occurred and nodes received the transactions.

On the DNA blockchain, every node receives a transaction (1a&1b), locally validates its content and signature(2a&2b), and re-broadcasts to its connected peers(3a&3b). The connected peers could be another API node or witness node.

Block producer nodes (a.k.a. Active witness nodes) will sign blocks if it is their turn (time slot), produce a block(5b) and broadcast(6b) the block to its connected peers.

If other nodes receive the block, they attempt it to make their copy of the blockchain.

Block producing nodes provide the blockchain with signed (like to think about it as "certified") blocks containing all new data that is previously submitted by account holders through API nodes.

Witnesses are selected based upon their commitment to remain neutral to blockchain policy.  Image, for extremely important contracts, a public notify is sometimes used. Neither witnesses nor notaries are party to the contract, but they serve a very important role of certifying the the contract was signed by the specified individuals at the specifies time.

In DNA witnesses serve a similar role of validating signatures and time-stamping transactions by including them in blocks.

Broadcast transaction methods
==============================

Network_broadcast_api has methods to broadcast transactions. Those methods are `broadcast_transaction` and `broadcast_transaction_with_callback`.

:broadcase_transaction:  Broadcast a transaction to the network. The transaction will be checked for **validity in the local database prior to broadcasting**. If it fails to apply locally, an error will be thrown and the transaction will not be broadcast.

.. code-block:: cpp

    void network_broadcast_api::broadcast_transaction(const signed_transaction& trx)
    {
       trx.validate();
       _app.chain_database()->push_transaction(trx);
       if( _app.p2p_node() != nullptr )
          _app.p2p_node()->broadcast_transaction(trx);
    }


:broadcast_transaction_with_callback:  This version of broadcast transaction registers a callback method that will be called when the transaction is included into a block. The callback method includes the transaction id, block number, and transaction number in the block.

.. code-block:: cpp

    void network_broadcast_api::broadcast_transaction_with_callback(confirmation_callback cb, const signed_transaction& trx)
    {
       trx.validate();
       _callbacks[trx.id()] = cb;
       _app.chain_database()->push_transaction(trx);
       if( _app.p2p_node() != nullptr )
          _app.p2p_node()->broadcast_transaction(trx);
    }

Example implementations of broadcast transaction
-------------------------------------------------

In a Wallet plugin, we can find many methods that use broadcast_transaction. There are example implementation patterns we can see and learn from. The below are the examples.

Pattern (1)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: cpp

   .......
	signed_transaction trx;
	trx.operations = {op};
	set_operation_fees( trx, _remote_db->get_global_properties().parameters.current_fees);
	trx.validate();

	return sign_transaction(trx, broadcast);


Before the end of method;

  1. ``signed_transaction`` instance is created
  2. Set an operation
  3. Set ``set_operation_fee``
  4. validate the instance

and use ``sign_transaction`` with the instance and broadcast flag to get a return.



:signed_transaction sign_transaction: 	Given a fully-formed transaction that is only lacking signatures, this signs the transaction with the necessary keys and optionally broadcasts the transaction.

  -	@param tx the unsigned transaction
  -	@param broadcast true if you wish to broadcast the transaction
  -	@return the signed version of the transaction



* Other methods that have the same pattern (wallet.cpp)

  - transfer_to_blind
  - propose_builder_transaction
  - propose_builder_transaction2
  - upgrade_account
  - create_asset
  - update_asset
  - update_asset_issuer

  - borrow_asset
  - borrow_asset_ext
  - cancel_order
  - transfer
  - issue_asset
  - propose_parameter_change
  - propose_fee_change
  - approve_proposal

Pattern (2)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: cpp

   signed_transaction tx;
   // do something...
   ..........
   if( broadcast )
 	 _remote_net_broadcast->broadcast_transaction( tx );

   return tx;


Before the end of method,

  1. ``signed_transaction`` instance is created,
  2. (do something...)
  3. check `broadcast` flag
  4. if broadcast=rue, send the instance by ``broadcast_transaction``

and return the instance.


* Other methods that have the same pattern (wallet.cpp)

  - register_account
  - create_account_with_private_key
  - sign_transaction
  - blind_transfer_help

Transactions and block
==============================

Blocks are produced by witnesses. Each block contains more than one transaction. Each transaction can contain more than one operation. And each operation has a "fee" element and other elements. You can find the :ref:`information about block structure here <lib-block>`.

You can see that each operation has own ``fee_parameter_type`` definition and calculates the fee.  About the "fee" is another big topic. We would like to visit it in another section.

What is a transaction in DNA blockchain? Well, you might say "group of operations". That's true also. We have implemented almost fifty operation types.  You can find :ref:`DNA blockchain operations list here <lib-operations>`.


Protocols (transactions)
-------------------------

There are protocols to build up DNA blockchain components and systems. A protocol is a set of rules. It might be a good idea to know what types of protocols (rules) DNA blockchain has.


:transaction: All transactions are sets of operations that must be applied atomically.

  - Transactions must refer to a recent block that defines the context of the operation so that they assert a known binding to the object idâ€™s referenced in the transaction.
  - Read more :ref:`Protocol: transaction <lib-transaction-anchor>`

:processed_transaction:  It captures the result of evaluating the operations contained in the transaction.

  - When processing a transaction some operations generate new ``object IDs`` which they are **not** permanent and these ``IDs`` can not be known until the transaction is actually included into a block that has become irreversible.
  - When a block is produced these ``new IDs`` are captured and included with every transaction. The index in ``operation_results`` should correspond to the same index in operations. If an operation did not create any new ``object IDs`` then ``0`` should be returned.

.. code-block:: cpp

	struct processed_transaction : public signed_transaction
	{
	  processed_transaction( const signed_transaction& trx = signed_transaction() )
			 : signed_transaction(trx){}

	  vector<operation_result> operation_results;

	  digest_type merkle_digest()const;
	};


:proposed_transactions: The Graphene Transaction Proposal Protocol. Graphene allows users to propose a transaction which requires approval of multiple accounts in order to execute.
