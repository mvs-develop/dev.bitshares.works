## DNA Wallet Types and Login

### Cloud Wallet
- DNA UI wallet will create a **Cloud wallet** as a default wallet. (i.e., [CREATE ACCOUNT])
- The Cloud wallet allows you to login from any web browser at any time to gain access to your account by using your credentials (username and password).
- The Cloud wallet only allows for a single account to be accessed at a time.
- If you have a Cloud wallet, you don't need to worry about a backup. (*You don't have the functionality in the Cloud wallet*).
- **You can switch the INTERFACE by using the [Settings] - [General] - [Login Mode], however your account won't switch, only the *interface* switches.**
- **Even you import Private keys (was in the Cloud wallet) to the Local wallet, you do not have a brain key to associate with the Private keys you imported. Therefor, a brainkey restore won't find those Private keys. (No meaning to do a brainkey backup and restore.)**
- **The Cloud wallet has no brainkey.** The password is basically the equivalent of the brainkey, but it's only used for that one account.

### Local Wallet
- **If you know you want to have a Local wallet, use an [advanced form] link on the Welcome to DNA form and create a backup file. This is the way to get a Local wallet.**
- The Local wallet creates a correct pair of keys (a brainkey and private keys) and save the information to your browser.
- The Local wallet creates a database with in your browser. This means that you can only access your funds from the same computer and web browser that you have used to register and create your account.  If you attempt to access your local wallet from any other computer, or any other browser, it will fail unless you actively import your backup file from the original browser backup file.
- You have to create a backup files to manage the Cloud wallet account.
- The Cloud wallet has Backup options. Go to [Settings] - [Backup] to find.
  - **Create local wallet backup** : create a Binary File (.bin) backup.
  - **Create brainkey backup** : give you long random phrases. You need to write down and keep it in a safe place.
- The backup files can be used to move your local wallet to different computers or different browsers. In order to restore your local wallet you will need the backup file and your password! Therefor, it’s extremely important you create a backup and keep a safe place.
